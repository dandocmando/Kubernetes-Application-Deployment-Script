A script to automatically provision a kubenetes application deployment created from onedr0p's https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template. Likely will not work on any other Kubernetes deployments unless they are structured the same as onedr0ps. Currently provisions storage via longhorn, rook-ceph will be added in the future.
